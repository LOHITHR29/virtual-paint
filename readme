# Air Canvas

Air Canvas is an interactive drawing application that uses computer vision and hand tracking to create a virtual drawing experience. Users can draw on a digital canvas using hand gestures captured by a webcam.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using MediaPipe
- Four color options: Blue, Green, Red, and Yellow
- Clear canvas functionality
- Intuitive gesture-based drawing

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- MediaPipe

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
```

## Usage

1. Run the script:

```
python air_canvas.py
```

2. A webcam window and a canvas window will appear.
3. Use your index finger to draw. Bring your thumb close to your index finger to stop drawing temporarily.
4. Use the color selection buttons at the top of the window to change colors.
5. Use the "CLEAR" button to reset the canvas.
6. Press 'q' to quit the application.

## How it Works

1. The application uses your computer's webcam to capture video input.
2. MediaPipe is used to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
3. The position of your index finger is used as the drawing point.
4. When your thumb is close to your index finger, drawing is paused.
5. The application provides a live view of your hand with landmark tracking, as well as a separate canvas where your drawings appear.

## Customization

You can modify the code to adjust various parameters such as:
- Canvas size
- Color options
- Brush thickness
- Gesture sensitivity

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure your webcam is properly connected and accessible.
- Good lighting conditions will improve hand tracking accuracy.
- If you experience performance issues, try reducing the webcam resolution in the code.
